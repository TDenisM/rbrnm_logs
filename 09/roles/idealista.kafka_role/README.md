## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your Ansible Playbook. Once launched, it will install a [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) distributed streaming platform in a Debian Environment.

### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.8.8 version installed.

Molecule 3.x.x version installed.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as driver and [Goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) as verifier.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```
- src: idealista.kafka_role
  version: 1.14.0
  name: kafka_role
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - role: kafka_role
```

## Usage

Look to the [defaults](defaults/main.yml) properties file to see the possible configuration properties.

Kafka topics could be configured through the role. Just set the topics like:

```yml
kafka_topics:
  - name: 'test'
    partitions: '3'
    replicas: '3'
  - name: 'test2'
    partitions: '3'
    replicas: '1'
```

Enable delete topic var if you want to remove topics from the cluster.

The number of partitions can be modified but not the replicas. Please have this in mind when create the topics.

Also notice that you can't decrease the number of partitions of a created topic.

## Testing

### Install dependencies

```sh
$ pipenv sync
```

For more information read the [pipenv docs](ipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Testing

```
